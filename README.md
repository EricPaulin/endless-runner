### [About Blob Run]
Blob Run is a simple runner game coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You play by either pressing Spacebar or by clicking the Start/Jump button. The game starts slow, but will
increase speed as you play longer. The further you get the higher your score and your high score is saved (until page reload). The game also works both on desktop and on mobile.

I have always wanted to make a game, so thought it would be fun to make this little runner game that reminds me of early flash browser games from the 2000s. I drew and animated all 
the sprites myself and that was a really fun learning experience. 

Thank you to anyone who gives my little game a play. The current leaderboard is just me. <sup><sub> I could only get a score of 7500 ðŸ˜¬ </sub></sup>
